    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/kojvxv9no7" target="_blank">original version of this sandbox</a> had an el-input with surprising behavior.</p>
    <p>One approach suggested by a team member was to use <a href="https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/#sub-delayed-validation-errors">debounced Vuelidation</a> instead as a stop-gap./p>
    <p>I had the bright idea that copying the styles from el-input to the properly behaving input tag could be a faster temporary fix.</p>
    <p>Little did I know...</p>
